# Lab | Neural Networks

## Introduction

Welcome to the Fashion MNIST Classification Lab! In this assignment, you will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers. Your task is to design, train, evaluate, and analyze the performance of your CNN model.

By completing this lab, you will strengthen your understanding of CNNs and gain practical experience in building and training models for image classification tasks.
